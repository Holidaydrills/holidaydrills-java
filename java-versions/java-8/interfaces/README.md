# Interfaces

Java 8 introduced some interesting new features around interfaces.  
You most probably know that all methods defined by an interface have to be implemented by the implementing class. This is not completely true anymore. With _default methods_ you can now define methods in an interface that don't necessarily have to be implemented. You can read more about this in the [Interface - Default Methods](interface-default-methods.md) chapter.  
Another novelty are _static interface methods_. With these you can define methods that can define some utility functionality that can be directly used by other classes. These methods cannot be overridden by the interface's implementing class. Read more about this in the [Interface - Static Methods](interface-static-methods.md) chapter.
