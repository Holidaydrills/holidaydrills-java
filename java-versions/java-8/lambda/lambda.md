# Lambdas
Lambdas or lambda expressions give a functional programming flavour to the Java language. With lambda expressions
it is possible to create functions that don't belong to any class or instance. You can pass these functions around
like parameters (e.g. pass them as method parameter) and reference them like they where objects.
